# Eco ExecutorüçÉ
This is a plugin made for developers to pentest or debug their game in studio. This plugin almost replicates executor API and the UI was inspired by the KRNL executor (which now has been shutdown)
Also, the executor uses an API called eAPI (a xAPI but it has been modified to fit perfectly with the level 5 identity since xAPI replicates executor functions and made it work with level 2 identity scripts)

## Installationüì•
Go to [releases](https://github.com/Overhault-Experiences/Eco-Executor/releases) and download the rbxmx file in the latest release.
Insert the rbxmx file into the game and 'save it as local plugin'. There should be a toolbar in the plugins tab (click to config the Eco Executor)

## Warning‚ö†Ô∏è
Running in an unpublished game will make some executor functions non-functional/un-useable.

# Creditsüî∑
 - [SQLanguage - xAPI](https://github.com/3skue/xAPI4/) - For executor functions
 - [HeyWhatsHisFace - Converter Module](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/converter-module-instance-%E2%86%94-table-save-instances-to-datastores-and-more/1820480) -- For saveinstance() support
 - The syntax highlighter is not mine, but I don't remember who created it! :( (also it has been modified to make it work with the executor)
