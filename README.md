# Eco ExecutorüçÉ
This is a plugin made for developers to pentest or debug their game in studio. This plugin almost replicates executor API and the UI was inspired by the KRNL executor (which now has been shutdown)
Also, the executor uses an API called eAPI (a xAPI but it has been modified to fit perfectly with the level 5 identity since xAPI replicates executor functions and made it work with level 2 identity scripts)
